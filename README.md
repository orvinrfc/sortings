# Sorting

This code is used to analyze different kind of sorting algorithms against different inputs.

The sorting algorithms that are included are:
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

To make sure that the analysis produce more accurate result, each sorting algorithm is tested against different input sizes *m* times.
We measure the time before and after the sorting algorithm takes *m* times.
The whole time taken will be divided by *m*, and the result is the average of the sorting algorithm.

For instance: an array of size 100 will be tested 10 times. The resulting time taken will be divided by 10 to produce the average time taken for that sorting algorithm.
